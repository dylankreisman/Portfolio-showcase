# Portfolio Showcase
This portfolio is meant to showcase my latest work in web development. It includes four sections: header, about me, work, and contact information. The purpose of this application is to show my work from this class, as well as act as a starting point for a continuous portfolio. 

## Process
I first made a skeleton of the html, and then started adding in CSS for the header. Once I had that done, I went through the html and organized the body into classes I needed, as well as toyed with how to make a flexible, responsive webage. 

As I played with the CSS, I began to build a greater understanding of the inline-blocks as well as flex stools, helping me build rows and columns within those rows. The process became pretty routine up until I coded in the contact page.
